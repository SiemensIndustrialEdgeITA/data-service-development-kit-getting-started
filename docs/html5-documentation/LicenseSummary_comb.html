By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\u003cbr\u003esoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\u003cbr\u003eusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\u003cbr\u003ea notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below,\u003cbr\u003erefers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot;\u003cbr\u003emeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\u003cbr\u003ethat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\u003cbr\u003eeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\u003cbr\u003elanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\u003cbr\u003ethe term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\u003cbr\u003ecovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\u003cbr\u003eof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\u003cbr\u003eof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                            NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003eFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\u003cbr\u003eIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\u0026quot;Attribution Parties\u0026quot;) in Licensor\u0026#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \u0026quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\u0026quot;). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\u003cbr\u003eExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author\u0026#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author\u0026#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Termination\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\u003cbr\u003eSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\u003cbr\u003e8. Miscellaneous\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\u003cbr\u003eEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\u003cbr\u003eIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\u003cbr\u003eNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\u003cbr\u003eThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\u003cbr\u003eThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\u003cbr\u003eCreative Commons Notice\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \u0026quot;Creative Commons\u0026quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003eb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003ec) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003eb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003ec) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eone line to give the program\u0026#39;s name and an idea of what it does.\u003cbr\u003eCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\u003cbr\u003emodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\u003cbr\u003eas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\u003cbr\u003eof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u003cbr\u003ebut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u003cbr\u003eMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\u003cbr\u003esoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\u003cbr\u003eusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\u003cbr\u003ea notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below,\u003cbr\u003erefers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot;\u003cbr\u003emeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\u003cbr\u003ethat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\u003cbr\u003eeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\u003cbr\u003elanguage.

The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003eFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\u003cbr\u003eIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\u0026quot;Attribution Parties\u0026quot;) in Licensor\u0026#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \u0026quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\u0026quot;). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\u003cbr\u003eExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author\u0026#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author\u0026#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Termination\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\u003cbr\u003eSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\u003cbr\u003e8. Miscellaneous\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\u003cbr\u003eEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\u003cbr\u003eIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\u003cbr\u003eNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\u003cbr\u003eThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\u003cbr\u003eThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\u003cbr\u003eCreative Commons Notice\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
